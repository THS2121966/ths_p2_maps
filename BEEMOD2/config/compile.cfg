[CorridorNames]
sp_entry_1_name = Right Turn
sp_entry_1_desc = A large corridor where players turn the corner to enter the chamber.
sp_entry_1_icon = overgrown/sp_entry/1.jpg
sp_entry_2_name = Staircase
sp_entry_2_desc = The corridor is lowered, dropping players downward before allowing them to enter up a staircase.
sp_entry_2_icon = overgrown/sp_entry/2.jpg
sp_entry_3_name = White Left
sp_entry_3_desc = This portalable corridor turns leftward.
sp_entry_3_icon = overgrown/sp_entry/3.jpg
sp_entry_4_name = Collapsed
sp_entry_4_desc = The entryway is collapsed, dropping debris in the path. If Repulsion Gel is present in the map, the gel has spilled to allow jumping over. If playing Aperture Tag, the gel gun is activated to allow doing this. Otherwise, portals are used (with autoportals being inserted if required).
sp_entry_4_icon = overgrown/sp_entry/4.jpg
sp_entry_5_name = Small Right
sp_entry_5_desc = A cramped corridor, with a collapsed wall to the side revealing background destruction.
sp_entry_5_icon = overgrown/sp_entry/5.jpg
sp_entry_6_name = Flooded
sp_entry_6_desc = This corridor is heavily flooded, with the floor collapsed and water raining in from the ceiling.
sp_entry_6_icon = overgrown/sp_entry/6.jpg
sp_entry_7_name = Tilted
sp_entry_7_desc = This corridor is tilted to the side substantially.

sp_exit_3_icon = overgrown/sp_exit/3.jpg
sp_exit_4_name = Floor Goo
sp_exit_4_desc = The floor is collapsed, preventing players from walking through the room. If Repulsion Gel is present in the chamber, the walls are covered with gel to allow bouncing to the exit. If playing Aperture Tag, the gel gun is activated to allow doing this. Otherwise, portals are used (with autoportals being inserted if required).
